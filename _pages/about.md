My name's Dominic Behrens, I'm an economist based in Sydney, Australia, currently working for Deloitte Access Economics. My work and interests are centred on urban economics, particularly housing, development and sustainable transport. 

In my spare time, I'm a passionate advocate for more affordable, sustainable and liveable cities, helping to set up advocacy organisation [Sydney YIMBY]{Sydney.yimby.au}, and serving on its committee.
