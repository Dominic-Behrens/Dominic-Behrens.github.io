Hello! My name's Dominic Behrens, I'm an economist based in Sydney, Australia, 
currently working for Deloitte Access Economics (DAE). My work is focused on 
urban and spatial economics, particularly housing, development and sustainable 
transport. I love working with large and complex datasets to answer interesting 
policy questions, and am passionate about using data to create better cities. 

Before beginning at DAE, I completed a Bachelor of Economics (Honours) at the 
University of New South Wales, with my thesis applying econometric methods to 
estimate the impact of the rollout of high-speed internet on election results 
in Australia.

In my spare time, I'm a passionate advocate for more affordable, sustainable 
and liveable cities, helping to set up advocacy organisation Sydney YIMBY, 
and continue to serve on its committee.
